/**
 * An "Individual" represents a single candidate solution. The core piece of
 * information about an individual is its "chromosome", which is an encoding of
 * a possible solution to the problem at hand. A chromosome can be a string, an
 * array, a list, etc -- in this class, the chromosome is an integer array.
 *
 * An individual position in the chromosome is called a gene, and these are the
 * atomic pieces of the solution that can be manipulated or mutated. When the
 * chromosome is a string, as in this case, each character or set of characters
 * can be a gene.
 *
 * An individual also has a "fitness" score; this is a number that represents
 * how good a solution to the problem this individual is. The meaning of the
 * fitness score will vary based on the problem at hand.
